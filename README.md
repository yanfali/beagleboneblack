BeagleBone Black Projects
=========================

My attempt to create a wifi access point for streaming videos. I have a Kingston widrive but I'm incredibly frustrated by it's slow startup time. Feels like a couple of minutes.

Using a BBB I'm able to boot in less than 20 seconds from power on and start serving video files from flash.

This part of the repo contains my working configuration files.
